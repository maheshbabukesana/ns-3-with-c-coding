all network devices are presumed to be equipped with IEEE 802.11s air interfaces. In this thesis work, the performance of the IEEE 802.11s standard routing protocol was analyzed to optimize their performance in the different type of scenarios. The IEEE 802.11s standard proposes Hybrid Wireless Mesh Routing Protocol (HWMP) composed of a proactive tree- based routing and the reactive Radio Metric Ad-hoc On-Demand Distance Vector (RM-AODV) scheme to support mesh networks. Through NS-3 Evalvid simulations.
Source code can be written in 3 different scenarios
